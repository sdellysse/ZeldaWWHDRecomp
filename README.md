# The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD — native port (macOS, Linux, Windows, Android)

A static recompilation of the Wii U version (USA or European) that runs natively on **macOS** (Apple Silicon),
**Linux**, **Windows** and **Android** (arm64; [build it yourself](#android-build-it-yourself)). The
game's PowerPC code is translated to C ahead of time, the Cafe OS libraries the game uses are
reimplemented natively, and GX2 graphics are implemented directly on Metal (macOS) or Vulkan (all
platforms), with no Cemu runtime and no GPU command emulation.

How it works and how it differs from running the game in Cemu: [docs/how-it-works.md](docs/how-it-works.md).

## What's new in this update

### Next update

### v0.2.11

- **Linux: one-file AppImage** (issue #55, PR #101, thanks @mhbxyz), next to the zip. Download it,
  make it executable, run it. It keeps the game, its compiled code, saves and settings in your user
  folders (`$XDG_DATA_HOME/wwhd`, usually `~/.local/share/wwhd`); `--data-dir` picks another folder.
  On distributions without libfuse2 (e.g. Ubuntu 24.04+) start it with `--appimage-extract-and-run`.
  The zip stays as it is.

- **Face buttons by label (Xbox layout)** (issue #78, PR #97, thanks @mhbxyz): settings overlay →
  Controls → *Face buttons* (also the macOS Controls window and Input menu). *By position
  (Nintendo)* stays the default; *by label (Xbox)* makes the button named A act as A, so on an Xbox pad
  A accepts and B goes back.

- **Ultrawide and tall screens: menus fixed** (issue #76, building on PR #16 by @arcadematicas): at
  21:9, 32:9, 16:10 and 4:3 the pause menu, inventory grid, cursor, map and the tabs stay centred at 16:9
  and line up again; backgrounds and the sepia filter still fill the picture.

- **Fixed: black letter card in the Rito mail-sorting game** (issues #28, #69, PR #39, thanks
  @Sean13128): the GPU's "0 × anything = 0" multiply is emulated now (as in Cemu). The shader caches
  rebuild once after updating, so expect a brief stutter on the first start.

- **Fixed: Cemu graphics packs**
  - packs that replace pixel shaders (e.g. Contrasty, NoSSAO, RemoveHUD) partly didn't apply on Vulkan
    since v0.2.10 (PR #87, thanks @rhemfur);
  - packs for the **European** version were refused with "Cemu pack does not target WWHD USA"
    (issue #103). A pack is now accepted when its `titleIds` name the version you installed;
    SDCafiine-style folders named after the title ID follow the same rule.

- **Smoother in busy views on Windows and Android:** the Vulkan buffer cache is now on by default
  everywhere. It keeps unchanged vertex, index and uniform data on the GPU instead of copying them
  every frame: on an RX 6700 XT 13–19% less render-thread time and half the uploads (issue #91, thanks
  @darklinkpower), on a Galaxy S25 Ultra about 34 → 47 fps in heavy Outset views (issue #56, thanks
  @rhemfur). If you see broken or flickering geometry, start with `WWHD_VK_BUFFER_CACHE=0` and please
  report it.

- **Less CPU work:**
  - native versions of the game's two hottest audio loops (PR #81, thanks @depende3000): the audio
    thread uses about two thirds less CPU, with bit-identical sound (also on the European version);
  - the scheduler sleeps while nothing is waiting, and GPU context switches copy only the registers
    that changed;
  - the recompiler no longer emits signed overflow for `mulli`/`mullw`/`neg` (PR #82, thanks
    @depende3000), a latent bug a newer compiler could have turned into wrong behaviour.

- **Android:**
  - when the system driver is too old for the renderer, Adreno phones offer **Install GPU driver…**
    right in the error message (PR #92, thanks @rhemfur);
  - on one-screen views the **GamePad screen appears automatically while the game is paused** (map,
    menus, save prompt) and the TV picture comes back when you resume (PR #59, thanks @rhemfur);
  - precise Vulkan synchronization (barriers) is on by default, where tile-based GPUs are expected to
    gain the most (issue #104). On desktop it's opt-in for testing: `WWHD_VK_NARROW_BARRIERS=1`.

- **Save states remember the controller mode** (Pro Controller or GamePad) and restore it on load.

- **"Keep game speed" explained:** with it off, the whole game runs in slow motion whenever the frame
  target isn't reached (e.g. 120/240 fps at 2x). The setting says so now, is marked as recommended, and
  the performance overlay warns when it happens (issue #91).

- **A log file for every run:** `captures/wwhd.log` in the game's data folder (the previous run's is
  kept as `wwhd-previous.log`), with your user paths removed as in crash logs. Please attach it to bug
  reports. `WWHD_LOG_FILE=<path>` writes it elsewhere, `WWHD_LOG_FILE=0` turns it off.

- **Code mods (Mod SDK v2, off by default):** mods written in C for the console's CPU, translated and
  built on your machine when you install them, for the USA and the European game. Turn them on in
  Settings → Mods → *Enable code mods* (this rebuilds the game code once; with it off nothing changes).
  For modders: [docs/mod-sdk-v2.md](docs/mod-sdk-v2.md).

- **Smaller fixes:** `WWHD_SHADOW_FIX` is gone, use `WWHD_SHADOW_SCALE=1` for console-sized shadow maps
  (issue #67: since v0.2.9 both sizes look practically the same); the buffer cache's verify mode no
  longer reads GPU memory (it ran at ~1 fps on some Windows drivers); a crash at exit with SDL 3.4 on
  Linux is fixed.

### v0.2.10

- **Fixed: the cheats in v0.2.9 wrote to the wrong place in the save data** (Give all items, Master
  Sword + Mirror Shield, 20 hearts / double magic / 5000 rupees) and could damage the save. They write
  to the right place again.
- **Fixed: Medli missing on Dragon Roost after using the Master Sword cheat** (issue #85). The cheat
  gave the full-power Master Sword as *owned*, which the game treats as story progress, so Medli (and
  later Makar) stayed away and the story couldn't continue. The cheat now only **equips** the Master
  Sword and Mirror Shield until the next reload. Saves already affected can be repaired with
  `tools/savegame/wwsave.py repair-medli` (it keeps a backup; see the save tools README).
- **Vulkan:** pixel shaders are now linked to their vertex shader when they are translated, so
  drivers that refused some pipelines get correct shaders from the start (PR #54 by @rhemfur, the
  proper fix for #30).

### v0.2.9

- **Play the European version directly** (title 00050000-10143600): setup now also accepts the
  European game on its own, without the USA version, and builds the port from it through an address
  map derived from the two executables (every function and call matched; contributed by **@ElFDA**,
  PR #77, with ideas from GreenNaugahyde's Android fork). German, Italian, British English, French and
  Spanish are its own languages then. Hooks, mods and save states work as on the USA version.
- **Bloom, distance haze and the sun's glare are back:** the game builds its glow from smaller
  copies of the picture, which the port never made; now it does, on Metal and Vulkan, so the picture
  looks like on the Wii U again. The sun's corona and lens flare react to whether the sun is hidden
  (adapted from GreenNaugahyde's Android fork). New **Settings → Graphics → Effects → Bloom
  strength** (0–200%, default 100%). On Macs, colours now go through the display's colour profile, as
  with Vulkan.
- **Android:** phones whose GPU can't read the game's compressed textures (many Mali and PowerVR
  GPUs) now decode them on the GPU instead of showing black or broken textures; on Snapdragon phones
  you can install and select custom Vulkan drivers such as Turnip (**Settings → Graphics**; a driver
  that crashes or hangs in its first seconds falls back to the system driver on the next start). Both
  follow the approach of [GreenNaugahyde's Android fork](https://github.com/GreenNaugahyde/ZeldaWWHDRecompAndroid),
  rebuilt on our renderer. Not yet tested on real Mali/PowerVR/Snapdragon devices: reports welcome.
- **Run and swim faster** (optional, Mods tab, off by default): hold L3 (or toggle) to boost Link's
  running and swimming speed, 1.25x to 4x; works with true 60. The idea comes from GreenNaugahyde's
  Android fork.
- **Average frame rate** in the performance overlay (and GPU load and temperatures on Android where
  readable); **crash logs** now include the settings in use, with your user paths removed, and Android
  offers to share the log after a crash.
- **Vulkan:** the compressed-texture feature is now enabled as the Vulkan specification requires.
- **Screenshot key:** **F10** saves the TV picture as a PNG in a `screenshots` folder next to the save
  states (`~/Library/Application Support/wwhd/screenshots`, `%APPDATA%\WWHD\screenshots`,
  `~/.config/wwhd/screenshots`; `data/user/screenshots` in a release folder), named
  `WindWakerHD_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.png`. It is the frame shown when you press the key (also at 60/120/240
  fps), at the internal resolution and aspect ratio (2x at 21:9: 3414x1440), with the game's own effects
  and FXAA when on, but without the settings overlay or notices; "Screenshot saved" shows briefly. The
  key can be changed (or a controller button added) in Controls ("Photo"); the Saves tab has **Open
  screenshots folder** and an option to also save the GamePad screen (`..._GamePad.png`) while it is
  shown. Saving happens in the background: the game does not stutter. Both renderers, all platforms.

- **Frame interpolation fixes (60/120/240 fps and true 60):** the waving flags on Dragon Roost no
  longer turn into huge stretched polygons on the in-between frames (issues #36, #70); the boat's sail
  and yard and items Link carries (a bomb) no longer jump for single frames (issue #68); the stars in
  the night sky no longer wobble when the camera turns (issue #68). 30 fps is unchanged.
- **Fixed: the pause menu would not close at 120/240 fps** (issues #64, #74; probably also #73, no
  control after an item-get message). The HD screens (the TV pause screen and others) advanced on every
  drawn frame instead of once per game step, so the TV pause screen reopened itself right after
  closing. They now update once per step, which also gives their fades their 30 fps speed back at
  60/120/240 fps.

### v0.2.8

- **Fixed: the game could freeze at startup with 0 fps on some Macs** (issue #62, MacBook Air M1).
  Newer Apple compilers turned the game's spin-wait loops into endless loops that never saw the other
  core release the lock. Every loop in the game code now re-reads memory on each pass; no measurable
  speed cost.
- **Fixed: Android crashed when changing the aspect ratio or internal resolution on some phones**
  (issue #72, Adreno 830). Phones whose driver cannot blit depth buffers now copy them with a small
  draw instead; nothing aborts any more if a device can do neither. Thanks to @Blivii for the analysis
  and the patch.
- **Fixed: grid pattern in contact shadows at higher internal resolutions** (issue #66). The game's
  shadow and ambient-occlusion blur now covers the same area as on the console at every resolution;
  1x is unchanged and there is no measurable speed cost. Shadow maps still scale with the internal
  resolution for sharp shadows; `WWHD_SHADOW_FIX=1` keeps them at the console's 1024x1024 instead,
  for soft edges that never shimmer (issue #67).
- **More languages (experimental):** with your own dump of the European or Japanese game, the port can
  use its text, fonts and menus: German, Italian, British English, European French and Spanish, or
  Japanese. See [docs/language-packs.md](docs/language-packs.md).
- **Fan translations as content mods**, including **Arabic and Hebrew** drawn right to left (issue #60),
  see [docs/mod-manager.md](docs/mod-manager.md) and [docs/rtl-text.md](docs/rtl-text.md).
- **macOS: closing the TV window quits the game** (issue #65), as on Windows and Linux. During a game
  it asks first: **Quit**, **Cancel** or **Save State and Quit**. `WWHD_QUIT_PROMPT=0` turns the
  question off.
- **Faster on Linux and Steam Deck (Vulkan):** the guest buffer cache is now on by default on desktop
  Linux, as on macOS. It keeps unchanged vertex, index and uniform data on the GPU instead of copying it
  every frame, which removed a 20 fps lock in busy views on an RK3588 board (issue #50). If you see broken
  or flickering geometry, start with `WWHD_VK_BUFFER_CACHE=0` and please report it. Windows and Android
  stay opt-in (`WWHD_VK_BUFFER_CACHE=1`).
- **Save states are now small and can go into bug reports.** The **Save state** button (and
  Shift+F1–F5, the Save States menu) now writes a *portable* state, `slotN.wwstate`: a few KB with
  your progress (the same save data the game writes into `cking.sav`) and where Link stands (stage,
  room, position, facing, time of day). It contains no game code and no game data, so you can attach
  it to an issue; **Copy save for bug report** in the Saves tab copies the paths of the state and of
  your `cking.sav`. Loading one puts that progress into the running game and takes Link there; it is
  not an exact snapshot (enemies, a running cutscene and other actors start fresh). The old full
  states (the whole running game, ~300 MB, contain game data: never share them) are still there for
  debugging: Saves › *Full save states*, or `WWHD_FULL_SAVE_STATES=1`. Loading a slot loads either
  kind; an older full state in a slot is kept and the Saves tab says so. A portable state can only be
  saved while you control Link (not during a cutscene or dialogue); one saved on the boat puts Link
  back on the boat. See [docs/portable-save-states.md](docs/portable-save-states.md).
- **Fixed: "Quick doors" could crash the game going through a door** (issue #61, "PROGRAM HALT
  J3DPacket.cpp:157"; reported in Tingle's jail on Windfall). The extra game steps that make doors
  quicker also deleted actors (a pot, a rat, Tingle) faster than the game allows: an actor that
  removed itself while a door opened was freed before its last drawn frame was done with. Deleting
  now keeps its normal pace; doors are as quick as before.
- **Gyro aiming fixes** (issues #45 and #71): a new **Turn left/right by** setting (settings overlay →
  **Controls** → **Gyro…**) with the usual gyro conventions: **Player space** (default: turn the controller
  left or right about the real vertical, however you hold it), **Yaw** (its own vertical axis) or **Roll**
  (tilt it like a steering wheel). Before, rolling the controller turned the view and turning it depended
  on how you held it. The default sensitivity is lower (0.5x, about one to one with your controller; the
  range now goes down to 0.05x), and settings that still have the old default start at the new one.
  Gyro aiming now also works in **Pro Controller** mode. For reports that the gyro stops after a while:
  the port no longer stops when a controller's sensor timestamps stall, switches to the controller you
  move when several are connected, turns a controller's sensors on again when they fall silent, and logs
  `[gyro]` lines that say why motion stopped (including a drifting right stick, which makes the game
  ignore the gyro). "Recenter" is now **Recalibrate** (learns the gyro's offset anew).

### v0.2.7

- **Fixed: taking a picture with the Picto Box crashed the game (Vulkan)** (issue #53). Right after
  the shot the game renders small 3D colour-grading textures slice by slice, which the Vulkan renderer
  did not support; on Metal the preview was black. Both renderers now render into 3D textures, and the
  saved pictures show up in colour in the Picto Box album (they were black on both renderers before).
- **Fixed: black shadows on macOS (Metal)** (issue #47). When macOS had to compile the game's shaders
  from scratch (first start, or after a macOS update cleared its shader cache), the ambient-occlusion
  pass could be skipped at the title screen while its shader was still compiling; the light buffer was
  then created with the wrong layout and stayed wrong for the whole session, turning shadowed areas
  black until a restart. Render targets no longer depend on that timing, and draws whose result the
  game reuses are never skipped. A cold start now spends about 0.7 s more on the title screen once.
- **Windows setup without PowerShell** (issue #58): the setup no longer runs a PowerShell script or
  removes the "downloaded from the internet" mark, and `Wind Waker HD.exe` downloads nothing: the
  official, signed embeddable Python now ships in the release (the Windows zip grows to about 19 MB).
  The programs carry version information and a manifest. Some antivirus engines (BitDefender and
  engines using it) may still flag the unsigned exe; that is a false positive and has been reported.
- **120 and 240 fps** (settings overlay → **Graphics** → **Frame rate**, or the macOS Graphics
  menu): frame interpolation now also draws 3 or 7 blended frames between the game's 30 logic steps
  a second, for 120 Hz and 240 Hz displays. Camera, models, particles, sea and every other blended
  effect move at even steps between two game steps; input, sound and menus behave as at 30 fps.
  The game detects the display's refresh rate (ProMotion Macs: 120 Hz; Windows, Linux and Android:
  the monitor's or phone's current rate, and Android phones are asked for their fast mode) and the
  overlay shows it ("Your display: 120 Hz"). A rate the display cannot show is capped to it:
  240 fps on a 120 Hz display draws 120, and 120 fps on a 60 Hz display draws 60. **Keep game
  speed** is on by default at 120/240 fps: when the computer cannot draw every frame, the game
  still runs at full speed with fewer in-between frames. Measured on
  an M3 Max with its 120 Hz display (Outset Island): 120 fps draws 115 frames a second on screen
  with Vulkan and 108 with Metal, at 29.1–29.7 game steps a second; without presenting, 119.3
  frames and 29.9 steps. 240 fps is limited by the renderer on that machine (about 146 frames a
  second when not capped to the display), so on a 120 Hz screen it draws the same as 120 fps.
- **"Uncapped" debug switch** (settings overlay → **Graphics**; not saved): no frame limit and no
  vsync, to see how many frames a second your computer can draw (window title and performance
  overlay). The game counts frames, so it runs faster than normal while it is on: not for playing.
  Metal and Vulkan; `WWHD_UNCAPPED=1` turns it on at start.
- **Keep game speed recovers faster after a hitch** (all frame rates): one slow frame (a shader
  compile, a scene load) no longer turns the in-between frames off for several seconds.
- **Android:** full-size occlusion depth is off by default (it halved the worst GPU waits on an
  Adreno 830, issue #56); the settings overlay can still turn it on.
- **Smaller fixes:** cheaper reuse checks of upload memory on Macs and integrated GPUs (follow-up to
  the v0.2.5 fix for issue #44), time limits for the Android CI build, and "mouse as
  gyro" no longer loses part of a movement when a frame stalls.

### v0.2.6

- **Far fewer shader translations and pipelines, fewer stutters in new areas, less memory
  (Vulkan):** the renderer now keys a translated shader only on the state that actually changes its
  translation (for example, only the textures a shader samples and the vertex inputs and outputs it
  uses), so the same shader is no longer translated again and again for different render states.
  Starting from an empty shader cache, Outset Island needed 569 translations and 204 pipelines
  instead of about 6,100–6,700 and 3,200–3,500, and Windfall 829 and 236 instead of about 4,300–5,000
  and 2,300–2,700. That takes about 100–115 MB less memory, cuts the frames that take over 50 ms
  by about a third, and lowers render-thread CPU time by 4–12%. It supersedes PR #46 by rhemfur,
  whose idea (keys that translate to the same shader share it and its pipelines) is part of it.
- **Performance reports say which build and system they come from** (issue #44): **Copy performance
  report** now starts with the version and commit, the operating system and version, the graphics card
  with its driver and Vulkan version (or the Metal device), and the rendering switches that are not at
  their defaults (buffer cache, CPU paths turned off, lazy DrawDone / async present turned off, the
  gyro source). The log's first lines name the version and system too, so crash logs carry them.

### v0.2.5

- **Fixed: much lower frame rate on Windows and Linux PCs with a dedicated graphics card (Vulkan)**
  (issue #44). Three renderer shortcuts that v0.2.4 turned on for all platforms compared new vertex
  and uniform data against the previous copy in the GPU's upload memory; reading that memory back is
  very slow on AMD and NVIDIA cards (one report went from 30 fps in v0.2.1 to 12 fps). The renderer
  now keeps those comparison copies in normal memory and never reads GPU upload memory, which also
  speeds up an older index-data path when the buffer cache is off.
- **Gyro aiming** (issue #45; settings overlay → **Controls** → **Gyro…**): aim the bow, hookshot,
  boomerang, telescope, Picto Box and grappling hook in first person by moving your controller, as
  with the Wii U GamePad. Sources: the gyro of a **DualSense, DualShock 4, Switch Pro, Joy-Con or
  Steam Deck** controller, a **Cemuhook (DSU)** server (DS4Windows, BetterJoy, phone apps;
  127.0.0.1:26760 by default), or the **mouse** (for Steam Input's "gyro to mouse"). Sensitivity,
  invert and a recenter button are adjustable. Off by default; the game's own **Options → Gyro**
  switch still applies. See `docs/gyro.md`.

### v0.2.4

- **Smoother 60 fps on slower PCs (Vulkan):** the render thread no longer waits for the GPU after
  every frame on Windows, Linux and macOS (the way Android already worked), so CPU and GPU work in
  parallel. Where the render thread is the limit, this is the difference between slow motion and
  full speed: in our load tests the game went from 35–40 fps with only a third to half of the 60 fps
  in-between frames drawn to a steady ~59 fps with almost all of them, at full game speed. Without
  a frame limit it renders 13–53% more frames per second, depending on the scene. (Issues #7, #44)
- **Less CPU work per frame (Vulkan):** 15 renderer shortcuts that were Android-only are now on
  everywhere (8–14% less render-thread time), and on macOS vertex, index and uniform data the game
  does not change stay on the GPU instead of being copied again for every draw (another 6–17% less
  render-thread time and 43–64% less data uploaded per frame). Windows, Linux and Android players
  can try that cache with `WWHD_VK_BUFFER_CACHE=1`; `docs/vulkan.md` ("Guest buffer cache") says
  what to report.
- **Performance report** (settings overlay → **Graphics** → **Copy performance report**): copies a
  breakdown of the render thread's time per frame to the clipboard, for bug reports about speed.
- **macOS: setup works when the app is opened straight from the downloaded folder** (issue #48).
  Every setup error now says what failed, what to do, and where the log is.
- **Sound in GamePad-only mode** (Off-TV Play, the Minus button): the game's sound now plays through
  your speakers instead of going silent (issue #49).

### v0.2.3

- **Mod manager** (settings overlay → **Mods**): the built-in mods (direct and mouse camera,
  first-person shortcut, wall climbing, quick doors, fast scenes) in one searchable list, plus
  **installable mod packages** from a folder or a `.wwhdmod` ZIP, with profiles, dependencies and
  per-mod options. Everything starts off; nothing from a package loads until you enable it.
  - **Content mods** replace game files without touching your game folder.
  - **Cemu graphics packs** (`rules.txt`) can be imported, with their presets and resolution rules;
    shader packs need the Vulkan renderer. Code patches from Cemu packs are not supported.
  - **Native mods** (packages with their own compiled code) ask for a one-time confirmation before
    they are enabled, because they run with the game's full permissions; only enable mods from
    sources you trust.
  See `docs/mod-manager.md` for the package format and the mod SDK.

### v0.2.2

- **Controller rumble fixed** (issue #35): rumble now follows the game's patterns exactly and always
  stops: on quit, after a crash, when the game hangs, while the settings menu is open and when the
  window is in the background. Before, a controller could keep vibrating until it was switched off.
  New **Rumble** on/off option in the settings overlay (Controls tab).
- **Older graphics drivers** (issue #37): Windows/Linux builds no longer refuse to start with
  "Entry Point Not Found" on drivers without Vulkan 1.3; they use the `VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering`
  extension where the driver offers it, and otherwise show a clear message naming the GPU, its
  driver version and what is missing.
- **Language tab:** only the languages your game contains can be chosen (the USA version has
  English, French and Spanish), and a changed language says that it applies after a restart.
- **Textures update exactly:** textures the game changes in memory are now always re-uploaded (on
  Metal and Vulkan); before, a change could show up a few frames late.
- **Full screen is remembered on Windows and Linux too** (issue #43), as it always was on macOS:
  leave the game in full screen and it starts in full screen next time.
- **Better crash logs:** a crash outside the game code names the library it happened in (for
  example the graphics driver), and the log lists the Vulkan layers that overlays add, so crash
  reports can be answered much faster.

### v0.2.1

- **Cemu archives (`.wua`)** (issue #27): the setup now also takes a Cemu `.wua` file; it is
  already decrypted, so no keys are needed. Every source (disc image, `.wua`, extracted folder) is
  checked for the right game version first (USA, version 0), with a clear message if an update is
  merged in or the region is different.
- **Linux on arm64** (aarch64): a separate `linux-aarch64` download (Raspberry Pi 5, Asahi Linux, ARM
  laptops).
- **On-screen text entry** (issue #29): the name screen now shows a text window over the game, with an
  on-screen keyboard for controllers and the mouse; typing on the keyboard goes straight into it.
- **Boot crash fixed:** the rare crash right after start ("Prepare Thread", agl shader setup) is gone.
  GX2CopySurface now completes before it returns, as the game expects; before, a late render thread
  could write into memory the game had already reused (about every 15th start under load, every start
  on some phones).
- **GamePad / Pro Controller choice is saved** between launches (issue #26).
- **Cheats** now also work on saves with heart pieces (PR #25 by Sean13128).
- **Android** (rhemfur, PRs #30, #31): pipelines the Adreno driver refuses no longer close the game,
  the game threads use at least two fast cores, and arm64 builds treat `char` as signed, as on the
  console.

### v0.2.0

- **Portable releases.** Unzip anywhere and start **Wind Waker HD**: the first start prepares
  the game once from your own dump (releases never contain game code, so it is built on your computer);
  later starts launch the game directly. Everything — the built game, the game files, saves,
  settings, save states, shader caches, logs and the downloaded compiler — stays in the release
  folder; nothing goes to your user folders unless you ask for a shortcut. An extracted game folder is
  used where it is instead of being copied. Saves and settings can be copied over from an earlier
  installation. Hold Shift while starting (or `--setup`) to repair, update or change the game.
- **Settings overlay** (Dear ImGui): an in-game menu for everything in one place — save states and
  Crash Recovery, graphics (renderer, frame rate, resolution, aspect ratio, AO, filtering, FXAA,
  performance overlay), display, gameplay mods and cheats (Graphics also has the Vulkan presentation mode), controls and language. Open it with
  **F1** (Fn+F1 on most Mac keyboards), **Cmd+,** / *Settings…* on macOS, or hold **Select** / press
  **Home** on a controller; it works with mouse, keyboard and controller on every platform and
  renderer. The Controls tab shows the controller drawing with live feedback of pressed buttons.
  Shift+F1 still saves state slot 1; slot 1 now loads from the overlay.
- **GamePad screen modes on Windows/Linux** (overlay → Display): separate window, picture-in-picture,
  automatic overlay, off, or GamePad only, as on macOS; clicks on the GamePad picture reach the game.
- **Full screen is remembered on Windows/Linux too** (issue #43): the TV window starts as it was left,
  in full screen or in a window, as the macOS app always did. `WWHD_FULLSCREEN=0|1` overrides it for
  one start.
- **60 fps "Keep game speed"** (overlay → Graphics → Frame rate, PR #21 by rhemfur): skips in-between
  frames instead of slowing the game down when the machine can't draw 60 frames a second; off by
  default. The performance overlay shows the share of in-between frames drawn.
- **Android: build it yourself** (rhemfur's port): see
  [Android (build it yourself)](#android-build-it-yourself). Also by rhemfur (PRs #19–#22, #24): the game's own icon for windows and shortcuts, name typing in every game window and optional
  Vulkan paths for slow devices.
- **Performance pass** (PR #15 by Sean13128): much less render-thread CPU on Metal (no more stutter
  while the shader cache warms up), a lighter vsync wait on Vulkan, and a fix for the both-renderer
  build crashing with Homebrew boost installed.
- **Cheats** (Gameplay menu / overlay, PR #15): all items, best sword and shield, 20 hearts, double
  magic, 5000 rupees, infinite health/magic/ammo, and story cheats (songs, Triforce shards, dungeon
  items, keys) — use a spare save file for those.
- **Graphics options are remembered** between launches (macOS since PR #15; Linux/Windows in
  `settings.ini`).
- **Controller rumble** (PR #13 by arcadematicas).
- **Linux/Windows**: GamePad touch with the mouse in the GamePad window, F11 / Alt+Enter full
  screen, closing the TV window quits (closing the GamePad window hides it), the name-entry text
  prompt works again (PR #14 by rhemfur), 1 ms timer resolution on Windows for smoother frame pacing
  (PR #12 by rhemfur), and a `--unwindlib=libgcc` build note for clang setups with libunwind.
- **Console language**: `WWHD_LANGUAGE=<code>` (or the overlay's Language tab) picks the game's
  language from those on the disc.
- **Native Windows LLVM builds** (PR #17 by resadent): build with clang and Visual Studio's Windows
  SDK, without MSYS2 (missing dependencies are built from pinned sources); smoother Vulkan frame
  pacing on Windows via SDL's high-resolution sleeps.
- **Vulkan presentation mode** (overlay → Graphics): *Vsync* (FIFO, default), *Low latency*
  (MAILBOX, where the driver offers it) or *Off* (IMMEDIATE); switches live and is remembered.
  `WWHD_VK_PRESENT_MODE` overrides it.
- **Faster Vulkan on Windows/Linux** (PR #18 by resadent): bounded draw batching and a higher
  game/render thread priority are now on by default, as on macOS.
- **GameCube save converter** (`tools/savegame`): bring your GameCube save file into HD — see
  [Optional: bring your GameCube save to HD](#optional-bring-your-gamecube-save-to-hd).

## Earlier updates

- **Linux and Windows builds** (Vulkan renderer with an SDL3 host), with automatic CI builds for both.
  Fixes from the first Linux reports: game paths are resolved case-insensitively (the game asks for
  `Audiores`, the disc folder is `AudioRes`; this crashed the game right after startup), build fixes
  for newer compilers, `WWHD_NO_GAMEPAD` only hides the GamePad window (`WWHD_NO_CONTROLLERS` turns
  off controllers), and a hint where to type when the game asks for text.
- **Crash logs and Crash Recovery**: every crash writes `captures/crash-<time>.log`. Crash Recovery
  (Save States menu, off by default) keeps automatic save states plus the recorded input, so a crash
  can be reproduced with `WWHD_REPLAY=<n>`.
- **`wudextract.py`**: the disc key file can be 16 raw bytes or 32 hex digits, with clear errors for
  a missing or non-matching key.
- **True 60 (key 7, experimental)**: every 30 Hz step is now exactly the 30 fps game's step (game
  logic, saves and quests stay as in the original); hookshot crash fixed. For smooth 60 fps,
  interpolation (key 6) is the recommended mode.

- **Vulkan renderer** (by OpenAI Codex), built into the same app next to Metal. Pick one in
  **Graphics › Renderer**; the choice is saved and used from the next start ("Restart Now"
  relaunches right away). Both share the same windows, menus, display modes, controls and mods.
  If Vulkan can't start (no Vulkan loader or MoltenVK installed), the game falls back to Metal and
  says why. Details: [docs/vulkan.md](docs/vulkan.md).
- **Full screen and GamePad screen modes** (Display menu): full screen for the TV window (⌘F),
  picture scaling (smooth, sharp, integer), and the GamePad screen as its own window, a
  picture-in-picture overlay, an automatic overlay that pops up when the GamePad picture changes,
  or off (⌘G shows/hides it).
- **Aspect ratio** (Graphics › Aspect ratio): 16:9 (original), match the window, 16:10, 21:9 or
  32:9. Wider screens see more to the sides (same vertical view); the HUD stays at the edges and
  menus stay centred.
- **Fixes**: misplaced Yes/No cursor in text boxes at 16:10, quitting with ⌘Q could hang, garbled
  characters in the window title. Community fixes from pull requests #1 and #2 (Miiverse manager
  throttling, shared shader-cache memory) are included.

- **60, 120 and 240 fps.** Modes in the Graphics menu and the settings overlay (Graphics › Frame rate):
  - **60 fps (key 6), 120 fps, 240 fps**: frame interpolation. The game logic keeps its original
    30 steps per second; the frames in between (1, 3 or 7 per step) are drawn blended between two
    steps (camera, models, particles, sea, wave crests, grass and trees, cloth, weather, lighting).
    Input, sound and menus behave as at 30 fps. The frames reach the screen up to the display's
    refresh rate (the overlay shows it, e.g. "Your display: 120 Hz"). "Keep game speed" (on by
    default at 120/240 fps, off at 60) skips in-between frames the computer or display cannot show
    instead of slowing the game down.
  - **True 60 (key 7, experimental)**: Link and the follow camera run their logic at 60 steps per
    second (for the actions that have been converted and measured against the original); everything
    else runs at 30 and is interpolated.
- **Higher internal resolution** (1x / 1.5x / 2x / 3x, key R) and **edge smoothing** (FXAA, key 8).
- **Save states**: a Save States menu with 5 slots (Shift+F1–F5 save, F1–F5 load), kept across
  sessions in `~/Library/Application Support/wwhd/states/`.
- **Controls window** (Input › Controls…): a drawing of the Wii U GamePad or Pro Controller; click
  a button to remap it to a key or a controller input, live feedback of pressed buttons and stick
  positions, conflict warnings.
- **Optional gameplay mods** (Gameplay menu, all off by default): climb any wall, direct right-stick
  camera, mouse camera, first person on the mouse wheel, quick doors, fast scene changes.
- **Fixes**: shadow streaks, flicker after loading, doubled wave sounds at 60 fps, camera issues.
- **Tools**: function naming against the GameCube decompilation (`tools/decomp/`), a differential
  harness that verifies hand-written source against the recompiled original (`tools/verify/`), and
  the 60 fps conversion tools (`tools/true60/`). See "Optional: decompilation tools" below.

## Legal notice

This is an unofficial fan project. It is not affiliated with, endorsed or sponsored by Nintendo.
"The Legend of Zelda", "The Wind Waker", "Wii U" and related names are trademarks of their
respective owners and are used here only to describe what this software is compatible with.

This repository contains **no game code, no game assets and no keys**: no executable, no
recompiled or disassembled game code, no textures, models, audio, shaders, screenshots or other
material from the game, and no console encryption keys. It contains only the tools and the
runtime written for this project (plus the third-party code listed under Credits).

To use it you need your own, legally obtained copy of the game, dumped from your own Wii U disc
and console. Everything game-specific (the extracted files, the recompiled code in `build/gen/`,
shader caches) is generated locally on your machine from your dump, and must not be
redistributed. The `.gitignore` keeps all of it out of the repository.

## Install (releases)

Releases are portable: unzip, start **Wind Waker HD**, choose your dump. Releases contain only this
project's runtime, tools and setup: **no game files, no game code and no keys**. The game's code can
only exist once it is built from your own dump, so the first start prepares the game once, on your
computer (about two minutes); every later start launches the game directly.

1. Download the zip for your system from the
   [Releases](https://github.com/ZeldaWWHDRecomp/ZeldaWWHDRecomp/releases) page and unzip it anywhere
   (a games folder, an external drive):
   - **macOS**: Apple Silicon, macOS 14 or newer (Metal renderer)
   - **Windows**: x86-64, Windows 10 or 11, a GPU with Vulkan 1.3 drivers (or Vulkan 1.1 / 1.2 drivers
     with `VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering`)
   - **Linux**: x86-64 (`linux-x86_64`) or arm64 (`linux-aarch64`, e.g. Raspberry Pi 5, Asahi Linux
     on Apple Silicon, other ARM boards and laptops), glibc 2.35 or newer (Ubuntu 22.04+, Debian 12+,
     Fedora 36+, Arch, SteamOS 3, Raspberry Pi OS 12), a GPU with Vulkan 1.3 drivers (or 1.1 / 1.2 with
     `VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering`). Take the zip
     that matches `uname -m` (`x86_64` or `aarch64`); setup says so if it doesn't. Or take the
     single-file **AppImage** (same two architectures) instead of the zip (issue #55): `chmod +x` it
     and start it from anywhere, Steam Deck included. Nothing is unzipped and the file itself is never
     written to.
2. Start **Wind Waker HD** (`Wind Waker HD.app`, `Wind Waker HD.exe`, or `wind-waker-hd` /
   `Wind Waker HD.desktop` on Linux). The first start asks for:
   - your **disc image** (`.wux` or `.wud`), a **Cemu archive** (`.wua`), or an already **extracted
     game folder** (with `code`, `content` and `meta`, e.g. from dumpling or Cemu). An extracted folder
     is used where it is, nothing is copied; a disc image or Cemu archive is extracted into the
     release folder (about 1.7 GB);
   - for a disc image, its **disc key** (a `.key` file with the image's name next to it is used
     automatically) and the **Wii U common key** (16 bytes, the same on every console; choose a key
     file or paste the 32 hex digits into the hidden field; a `common.key` next to the image or in the
     release folder is used automatically). Keys are checked before anything is extracted, never
     stored, and not part of any log. A Cemu archive or an extracted folder needs no keys.
   - A Cemu archive (Cemu's "Convert to compressed Wii U archive (.wua)") often holds the game, its
     update and DLC together. Setup uses the game itself, title 00050000-10143500 (USA) or
     00050000-10143600 (Europe), version 0, and says
     so in its log; an update in the archive is not used: the port is built for the code of version 0,
     and the update's files belong to its newer code. The archive's checksum is verified before
     anything is extracted.

   Then it prepares the game (extract, translate the code to C, compile with a pinned compiler) and
   offers to bring in a save: a Wind Waker HD `cking.sav` folder (Cemu, Wii U), a GameCube `.gci`
   (converted to HD), or the saves and settings of an earlier installation or another Wind Waker HD
   folder (copied, never moved). The USA version (title 00050000-10143500) and the European one
   (00050000-10143600) are supported, version 0 of either (the disc or eShop release, without the
   update): before translating, setup checks the game's code (`code/cking.rpx`) against the SHA-256
   of each and explains what to use instead when it matches neither (e.g. a game folder with an
   update copied over it). The European game plays in English, French, German, Italian or Spanish —
   its own text, chosen in the settings' Language tab. How one port serves both:
   [docs/builds.md](docs/builds.md).
3. That's it: start Wind Waker HD to play. To repair, update or change the game, hold **Shift** while
   starting it (macOS, Windows) or start it with `--setup` (Linux; also the "Setup" action of its
   menu entry).

First start, per system:
- **macOS**: the release is not signed by Apple, so the first time macOS says the app "cannot be
  opened". macOS 14: right-click (Ctrl-click) the app, **Open**, **Open**. macOS 15 and newer: click
  **Done**, then **System Settings › Privacy & Security › Open Anyway**. If Apple's Command Line Tools
  (the free compiler, which also brings Python) are missing, Wind Waker HD offers Apple's installer.
  Start the app **inside the unzipped folder** and keep it there: it needs `tools/`, `sdk/` and
  `portable.txt` next to it. Don't drag only `Wind Waker HD.app` into Applications; to keep the game
  somewhere else, move the whole folder. The folder must be writable (not a disk image or a read-only
  drive). If macOS asks whether Wind Waker HD may access your Downloads (or Desktop, Documents) folder,
  click **Allow**: the game is prepared in that folder. Releases up to v0.2.3 stopped with "Setup could
  not continue … must stay in the unpacked release folder" when started straight from the unzipped
  download (issue #48, macOS App Translocation); with those, run
  `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine <the unzipped folder>` in Terminal once, then open the app again.
  When setup cannot continue it says what failed and what to do, and writes it to
  `data/setup-window.log` (or `~/Library/Logs/Wind Waker HD setup.log` when the folder is not writable).
- **Windows**: the release is not code-signed, so SmartScreen may say "Windows protected your PC":
  **More info › Run anyway**. Python comes with the release (`tools/python`, the official embeddable
  Python). The first start downloads the compiler (llvm-mingw, 190 MB) into the release folder, SHA-256 checked, no administrator rights; at the end you can remove
  the compiler again (it is only needed to repair, and downloaded again then).
- **Linux**: start `wind-waker-hd` (or `Wind Waker HD.desktop`; some desktops ask to allow launching
  it first). It uses your Python 3 and downloads the compiler (zig, 55 MB; the x86-64 or arm64 build
  matching your system) into the release folder;
  you can remove it at the end.
- **Linux (AppImage)**: `chmod +x WindWakerHD-*-linux-*.AppImage`, then start that file (from a file
  manager, a terminal or Steam as a non-Steam game). It needs no unzipping and no writable folder of
  its own. Ubuntu 24.04 and newer have no FUSE by default: install `libfuse2t64` (`libfuse2` on older
  releases), or start it with `--appimage-extract-and-run`. Repair or change the game with `--setup`.
  Everything it creates is listed under "Everything stays in the release folder" below.

**Everything stays in the release folder** (in `data/`): the built game, the extracted game files,
saves (`data/save`), settings, controls, save states and shader caches (`data/user`), crash logs
(`data/captures`), the setup log and the downloaded compiler. Nothing is written to your user folders
(Application Support, AppData, .config, Applications, Start menu) unless you tick "add a shortcut" at
the end. To remove everything, delete the folder. Starting a newer release: unzip it next to the old
one, start it, choose your game (the old folder's `data/game` can be used in place) and copy your saves
and settings from the old folder.

The **Linux AppImage is not a portable folder** (issue #55): its file is read-only, so the game, its
code and saves go to `~/.local/share/wwhd` and the settings, controls, save states and caches to
`~/.config/wwhd` (or `$XDG_DATA_HOME` / `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`; `--data-dir FOLDER` chooses another place
for the first, for example an SD card on a Steam Deck). Nothing is written beside the `.AppImage`; the
menu entry the setup adds starts the same game. To remove everything, delete the file and those two
folders.

The setup also runs in a terminal (the fallback): `tools/Setup in Terminal.command` (macOS),
`tools/Setup in a console window.bat` (Windows), `tools/setup-in-terminal.sh` (Linux). How it works
and the interface between the window and `tools/installer/setup.py`:
[tools/installer/README.md](tools/installer/README.md). Scripted use: `tools/installer/setup.py --help`.

Source builds (below) and the Linux AppImage are not portable: they keep using the per-user folders
(`~/Library/Application Support/wwhd`, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\WWHD` for the game and saves,
`~/.config/wwhd` for the settings on Linux), as before.

## Requirements (building from source)

- **macOS** on Apple Silicon, **Linux** (x86-64 or arm64, Vulkan) or **Windows** (x86-64, Vulkan); the
  platform-specific build steps are under "Building" below
- macOS: Xcode command line tools (`xcode-select --install`)
- zstd for the extractor's `.wua` support: a system one if installed (`brew install zstd`, `apt install
  libzstd-dev`; found through its CMake package or pkg-config), otherwise CMake downloads the pinned
  source (`-DWWHD_BUNDLED_ZSTD=ON` always does, as release builds do)
- CMake 3.20 or newer
- Python 3 with `pycryptodome` for `tools/wudextract.py` (`pip3 install pycryptodome`); the native
  `wwhd-extract` built with the project (`build/cmake/wwhd-extract --help`) needs neither
- optional: `capstone` (`pip3 install capstone`) for the disassembler helper `tools/ppcdis.py`
- optional, decompilation tools only: `ninja` and the requirements of the zeldaret/tww build
  (see below)

You also need, from your own console and disc:

- a disc image of The Wind Waker HD (USA or Europe) in `.wud` or `.wux` format (or a Cemu archive,
  `.wua`: `build/cmake/wwhd-extract --title 0005000010143500 extract game.wua game`, with
  `0005000010143600` for the European game, no keys);
- its disc key (16 bytes) in a `.key` file next to the image, with the same base name;
- the Wii U common key, either in a file `common.key` (16 raw bytes or 32 hex digits) next to
  the image or in the current directory, or in the `WIIU_COMMON_KEY` environment variable
  (32 hex digits). As a text file it is one line of 32 hex digits, nothing else; a wrong or
  malformed common key also makes the extraction fail with a decryption error.

None of these are included or will be provided.

## Building

For the Vulkan renderer also: `brew install vulkan-headers vulkan-loader molten-vk glslang` (the
build needs them; the app still runs with Metal on a Mac without them). `-DWWHD_RENDERER=METAL`
builds a Metal-only app without any Vulkan dependency.

```sh
# 1. extract the game into game/ (game.wux with game.key next to it, plus your common key)
python3 tools/wudextract.py game.wux extract game
#    -> game/code/cking.rpx, game/content/..., game/meta/...

# 2. recompile the game code to C (writes build/gen/; stays on your machine)
python3 tools/recomp/recomp.py game/code/cking.rpx build/gen

# 3. build
cmake -S . -B build/cmake && make -C build/cmake -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu) wwhd
```

### Linux

The Linux build uses the Vulkan renderer with the SDL3 host (windows, input, audio).

With Nix on x86-64 or arm64 Linux, the development shell provides the compiler and build dependencies:

```sh
nix develop
python3 tools/wudextract.py game.wux extract game
python3 tools/recomp/recomp.py game/code/cking.rpx build/gen
cmake -S . -B build/linux -G Ninja
cmake --build build/linux
```

The extraction step needs your own game image and keys, as described above. If you already have
`build/gen/`, start with the CMake command.

On Ubuntu 24.04 without Nix:

```sh
sudo apt install clang cmake ninja-build zlib1g-dev liblz4-dev libvulkan-dev glslang-dev \
  mesa-vulkan-drivers libx11-dev libxext-dev libxrandr-dev libxcursor-dev libxi-dev libxss-dev \
  libxfixes-dev libxkbcommon-dev libwayland-dev libasound2-dev libpulse-dev libudev-dev libdbus-1-dev
# SDL3 is not packaged in 24.04: build it from source (https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL, release-3.2.x)
cmake -S . -B build/linux -G Ninja -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++
cmake --build build/linux
./build/linux/wwhd --renderer-smoke     # checks the Vulkan renderer, no game files needed
```

If linking fails with unwinder errors (missing `_Unwind_*` symbols or `-lunwind`), your clang is set up to
use LLVM's libunwind. Configure with the GCC unwinder instead:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build/linux -G Ninja -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ \
  -DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS="--unwindlib=libgcc"
```

Closing the TV window ends the game; closing the GamePad window only hides it. F11 or Alt+Enter toggles
full screen for the focused window.

On Arch-based systems (Arch, CachyOS, Manjaro):

```sh
sudo pacman -S clang cmake ninja sdl3 vulkan-headers vulkan-icd-loader glslang shaderc python-pycryptodome
# plus the Vulkan driver for your GPU, e.g. vulkan-radeon (AMD) or vulkan-intel
```

Wii U volumes are case-insensitive and the game asks for paths in a different case than the
extracted folders (e.g. `Audiores` vs `AudioRes`); the runtime resolves such paths itself on
case-sensitive file systems. When the game asks for text (your name), a text window appears over
the game (see *Entering text* under Playing).

On Linux and Windows, **F11** or **Alt+Enter** switches the focused window (TV or GamePad) to full
screen and back; the TV window's full screen (also the settings overlay's *Display > Full screen*) is
remembered in `settings.ini` and the next start begins the same way. Clicking/dragging with the left mouse button in the GamePad window uses the
touch screen. The GamePad screen has the macOS modes (settings overlay, *Display*): a separate
window, a picture-in-picture overlay in a corner of the TV window (corner, size and opacity
selectable; click it to touch), the automatic overlay, off, or the GamePad picture alone in the TV
window (click it to touch); **Ctrl+G** shows/hides it, and the choices are saved in `settings.ini`. The macOS menus (Graphics, Display, Input, Save States) don't exist in these builds
yet; their settings are available as environment variables (below) and the number-key shortcuts.

Settings, controls and save states live under `~/.config/wwhd` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wwhd`).
To check the build without the game, `python3 tools/recomp/stubgen.py build/gen-stub` writes
placeholder guest code and `-DGEN_DIR=$PWD/build/gen-stub` builds against it (the result cannot
run the game).

### Windows

The Windows build uses the same Vulkan renderer and SDL3 host as Linux. Both native LLVM and
MSYS2 CLANG64 builds are supported. Choose either method below and use separate build directories
when switching toolchains. Both require the generated `build/gen` from the recompiler steps above.

#### Native LLVM (PowerShell, without MSYS2)

Install LLVM (with `clang` and `clang++`), CMake, Ninja, Visual Studio's **Desktop development
with C++** workload (for the Windows headers and runtime libraries), and the Vulkan SDK. Ensure
`clang`, `clang++`, `cmake` and `ninja` are on `PATH`, and `VULKAN_SDK` points to the SDK installation.
Run from PowerShell:

```powershell
cmake -S . -B build/windows -G Ninja -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build/windows
ctest --test-dir build/windows --output-on-failure
./build/windows/wwhd.exe --renderer-smoke
```

CMake uses installed native dependency packages where available and downloads pinned source
releases of missing glslang, SDL3, zlib and LZ4 dependencies into the build directory. The first
configure therefore needs internet access. SDL3's DLL is copied next to the executable. To use
an existing zlib installation, set `ZLIB_ROOT` or the standard `ZLIB_INCLUDE_DIR`,
`ZLIB_LIBRARY_RELEASE` and `ZLIB_LIBRARY_DEBUG` cache variables.

#### MSYS2 (CLANG64 shell)

Install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/), open its **CLANG64** shell, and install the toolchain and
dependencies with `pacman`. This method uses MSYS2 packages and does not require Visual Studio
Build Tools or the separate Vulkan SDK:

```sh
pacman -S mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-{clang,cmake,ninja,python,vulkan-headers,vulkan-loader,glslang,sdl3,lz4,zlib}
cmake -S . -B build/windows-msys2 -G Ninja -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build/windows-msys2
ctest --test-dir build/windows-msys2 --output-on-failure
./build/windows-msys2/wwhd.exe --renderer-smoke   # checks the Vulkan renderer, no game files needed
```

Run it from the CLANG64 shell, or copy the DLLs it needs (`SDL3.dll`, `libc++.dll`,
`libunwind.dll`, zlib) from `C:\msys64\clang64\bin` next to `wwhd.exe`; `vulkan-1.dll` comes with
your GPU driver. Settings, controls and save states live in `%APPDATA%\WWHD`. Python for the
extraction and recompiler steps can be the MSYS2 one (`pip install pycryptodome`).

For either method, use Release for gameplay performance. Microsoft's `cl.exe` compiler is not
supported because the recompiled game requires Clang's `musttail` support.

The build fails with a clear message if `build/gen` has not been generated. The runtime checks at
startup that `game/code/cking.rpx` matches the recompiled code.

### Android (build it yourself)

The Android port is by [rhemfur](https://github.com/rhemfur) (issue #23): the Vulkan renderer on
an arm64 phone through SDL3's Android activity, measured at 30–32 fps in the heaviest scenes on a
Galaxy S25 Ultra (Snapdragon 8 Elite). There is no download: **releases never contain an APK,
`libmain.so` or anything derived from the game files**, and they never will. You build the APK
yourself from your own dump, and since it contains your recompiled game, it is for your own phone
only: don't share it. (CI builds the APK only with placeholder code, to check that it compiles.)

You need:
- a phone with arm64, Android 13 or newer and Vulkan 1.3;
- **a game controller** (Bluetooth or USB). It is the GamePad's buttons and sticks; the touch
  screen is only the GamePad's touch screen (no on-screen buttons). Keyboards only type text
  (`WWHD_ANDROID_KEYBOARD=1` in `env.txt` makes them a GamePad too);
- on the computer: the Android SDK (platform 36, build tools 35.0.0), NDK 30.0.16248370, JDK 17
  or newer, CMake 3.20+ and Ninja, Python 3, and your own `build/gen` (steps 1 and 2 under
  Building).

```sh
android/build_native.sh            # libmain.so, libSDL3.so, libc++_shared.so -> android/app/libs
#   CPU=generic (default): any arm64 phone; CPU=oryon-1: tuned for the Snapdragon 8 Elite (e.g.
#   Galaxy S25), runs only there. ANDROID_SDK, NDK_VERSION, GEN_DIR, JOBS: see the script.
python3 android/make_icon.py       # optional: the launcher icon from your game/meta/iconTex.tga (Pillow)
cd android && ./gradlew assembleRelease
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

Start the app once: it creates `Android/data/org.wwhdrecomp.wwhd/files/` on the phone's storage
(reachable over USB). Copy your extracted game there as `game/` (`code/`, `content/`, `meta/`);
`save/` takes a save (`user/cking.sav`, the same layout as on the computer); `config/wwhd/` holds
`settings.ini` and the shader caches; an optional `env.txt` takes `WWHD_` options, one `NAME=value`
per line. Long-press the app icon to export or import the save as a zip.

In the game, the button in the top left corner switches the view: a tap cycles TV with the GamePad
picture in a corner, the GamePad picture alone (Minus in the game switches to Off-TV Play, the game
on the GamePad) and the TV alone; a long press switches 60 fps (its dot: green on, yellow while the
phone pauses it because it is too slow or too hot). Touches on the GamePad picture touch the
GamePad. The settings overlay (hold Select or press Home) has the other GamePad screen modes and
the graphics options.

## Playing

```sh
./build/cmake/wwhd                 # options: --game DIR (default game), --save DIR (default save)
```

`--renderer=metal` or `--renderer=vulkan` (or `WWHD_RENDERER_RUNTIME=metal|vulkan`) overrides the
saved renderer choice for one start.

**Vulkan presentation** (settings overlay › Graphics › Presentation): *Vsync (smooth)* (FIFO, the
default), *Low latency* (MAILBOX: the newest frame at each refresh, no tearing) or *Off (may tear)*
(IMMEDIATE). Only modes the driver offers can be chosen (MoltenVK on macOS offers vsync and
immediate, no mailbox); a change applies at once and is saved with the other graphics options.
`WWHD_VK_PRESENT_MODE=fifo|mailbox|immediate` overrides it for one start (not saved). The log says
which mode is in use and which the driver offers (`[vulkan] TV present mode fifo (available: …)`).

Two windows open: the TV and the GamePad screen (map, items, menus). Click and drag in the
GamePad window to use the touch screen. Saves go to `save/`.

**Settings overlay:** press **F1** in the game window, or **Cmd+,** on macOS (also *Settings…* in the app
menu; most Mac keyboards send F1 only with **Fn+F1** unless "Use F1, F2, etc. keys as standard
function keys" is on), or hold Select / Minus for half a second, or press Home, on a controller, for an in-game menu over the picture: save states, graphics, display (full screen, remembered for
the next start; picture scaling; the GamePad screen),
gameplay mods and cheats (Graphics also has the Vulkan presentation mode), controls (the same controller drawing as Input > Controls…: select a
button or chip and press the key or controller input to use; also on Windows and Linux) and the
console language (only the languages your game contains can be chosen; the USA game has English,
French and Spanish, the European one English, French, German, Italian and Spanish; experimental:
those languages from your own European or Japanese copy of the game played with the USA code, see
[docs/language-packs.md](docs/language-packs.md); fan translations
into Arabic or Hebrew are drawn right to left, see [docs/rtl-text.md](docs/rtl-text.md)).
Mouse, keyboard (arrows, Enter, Esc) and controller (D-pad / stick, A, B; L / R switch tabs) all work.
The game keeps running but gets no input while it is open; Esc, F1 or B closes it. On macOS it shows
the same options as the menu bar, and both stay in sync. Shift+F1 still saves state slot 1; slot 1 is
loaded from the overlay (F1 used to load it).

**Entering text (the name screen):** when the game asks for text — your name when you start a new
file — a text window appears under the game's own name field (also in the GamePad-only and
picture-in-picture modes; it scales down to fit, and on very small windows moves up over the field),
with a field, a character counter (the name takes up to 8 characters) and an on-screen keyboard. The
game's field shows the name in the game's font as you type. Only characters the game's font can draw
are offered: the keys and typed characters are checked against the font the name is drawn with
(`CKingMsg.bffnt`, read from your own game files at run time); a missing one is refused with a short
note. Type on the keyboard (any layout, accents and dead keys, input methods), **Enter** = OK,
**Esc** = Cancel, Backspace / Delete / arrows edit. With a controller: D-pad or left stick choose a
key, **A** types it, **B** deletes, **X** adds a space, **Y** is Shift (once, then Caps), **L / R**
switch between letters, accented letters and symbols (kana on a Japanese game), **ZL / ZR** move the
caret, **Start** or the OK key confirms. The mouse clicks keys too; on Android the system keyboard
also opens. The game gets no input while the window is open, and none after it closes until the
button that confirmed is released. `WWHD_SWKBD_TEXT=<name>` answers automatically (test runs); only
where the overlay can't show does the old prompt remain (the typed text in the window title on
Windows/Linux, a dialog on macOS).

### Controls

Default keyboard layout:

| Keyboard | Wii U GamePad |
|---|---|
| W A S D | left stick (move) |
| arrow keys | right stick (camera) |
| K or Space | A |
| J | B |
| L | X |
| I | Y |
| Q / E | L / R |
| Left Shift | ZL (target) |
| C | ZR |
| Enter / Tab | + / − |
| H | Home |
| 1 2 3 4 | D-pad up / down / left / right |
| X / V | left / right stick click |

**Input › Controls…** remaps everything on a drawing of the controller: click a button, stick
direction or stick click, then press a key or a controller button / stick direction (each input
has a key, an alternate key and a controller binding); Esc cancels, right-click clears. Pressed
buttons light up and the sticks show their deflection, so you can test the mapping; a key bound
twice is marked with a warning. Changes apply immediately, also while playing. A dead zone for
controller sticks and an option to invert the camera's up/down are at the bottom, with **Reset to
Defaults…**. The mapping is saved to `~/Library/Application Support/WWHD/controls.json`
(`WWHD_CONTROLS=<file>` uses another file); deleting it restores the defaults. The app's
single-key shortcuts (R, O, M, N, 6–9, P, F1–F5, F12) and Esc can't be bound. The **Screenshot**
key (row "Photo", **F10** by default) is bound here like a button, to a key or a controller input.

The **Graphics** menu in the menu bar switches fixes and enhancements while playing (the TV
window title shows what is active and the current frame rate): 60 fps by frame interpolation
(**6**; 120 and 240 fps in the menu and the settings overlay), true 60 fps (**7**, experimental), internal resolution 1x / 1.5x / 2x / 3x (**R**
cycles; the game renders at 1280x720, 2x renders at 2560x1440), edge smoothing (FXAA, **8**),
ambient-occlusion mode (**O** cycles), full-size occlusion depth (**M**), 16x anisotropic
filtering (**N**), the aspect ratio, the renderer (Metal or Vulkan), **Take Screenshot** (**F10**,
rebindable in Controls: the TV picture as a PNG at the internal resolution, without the settings
overlay, in `~/Library/Application Support/wwhd/screenshots`; also *Open Screenshots Folder* and an
option to save the GamePad screen too), and a frame capture for debugging (**P** or fn+F12, written to `captures/`;
captures contain game imagery, so keep them to yourself). The Graphics choices are remembered
between launches (macOS preferences; `defaults delete wwhd` resets them).
True 60 (**7**) computes Link and the camera at 60 Hz while the game state after every 30 Hz step
stays bit-identical to the 30 fps game, except the random-number sequence, which drifts because
drawing code draws random numbers too (later drops and ambient behaviour differ like in any other
session; see docs/decomp-notes.md, "True 60 fps").

The **Gameplay** menu has optional changes to how the game plays, all off by default: climb any
wall (with a stamina wheel; B or A lets go), a direct right-stick camera (no easing, adjustable
speed), a mouse camera (click the picture to capture the pointer, Esc releases it), first person
on the mouse wheel, quick doors and fast scene changes.
It also has cheats: all items, the full-power Master Sword and Mirror Shield, 20 hearts / double
magic / 5000 rupees, and infinite health, magic or ammo. Story cheats (all songs, Triforce shards,
dungeon map/compass/boss key, a small key) can change or break story events, so use a spare save
file. Cheats edit the live save data; save in game to keep them.

The **Save States** menu (and the Saves tab of the settings overlay) saves to one of 5 slots and
loads it back (**Shift+F1–F5** save, **F2–F5** load; slot 1 loads from the F1 settings overlay);
each slot shows its time and area. Slots are kept in `~/Library/Application Support/wwhd/states/`
and survive restarts. By default a slot holds a **portable state** (`slotN.wwstate`, a few KB):
your progress and Link's place, no game data, safe to attach to bug reports. Loading one works
once a Quest Log is being played (it waits until then): the progress is put into the game and Link
enters the saved stage at the saved spot (on the boat if he was on it). It is not an exact snapshot:
enemies, cutscenes and other actors start fresh. A portable state can only be saved while you
control Link (not during cutscenes, dialogue or stage changes). A state from another Quest Log is
loaded into the one being played, with a notice.
**Full save states** (Save States menu or Saves tab, off by default, for debugging;
`WWHD_FULL_SAVE_STATES=1`) save the whole running game instead (`slotN.bin`, about 270 MB) and
restore it exactly; they contain game code and data, **never share them**. A full state made by an
incompatible build is refused. Loading a slot loads whichever kind it holds.

**Crash Recovery** (Save States menu, off by default, or `WWHD_CRASH_RECOVERY=1`): every 2 minutes the
game is saved into one of three automatic states (`states/auto/`, about 260 MB each; the save
freezes the game for about 0.1 s), and the controller input since the latest one is recorded. After a
crash, the crash log names them, and `WWHD_REPLAY=<n> ./build/cmake/wwhd` loads automatic state n and
plays the recorded input back to reproduce the crash. Automatic states can also be loaded from the menu.

Game controllers (Xbox, PlayStation, Switch Pro, MFi) work too; by default buttons map by
position (the bottom face button is the Wii U's B), and they can be remapped in the Controls window.
**Face buttons** in the settings overlay (F1 → Controls) or the Input menu switches that preset:
*by position (Nintendo)* is the default; *by label (Xbox)* makes the button named A drive the Wii
U's A instead — on an Xbox pad that means A accepts/acts and B goes back (issue #78), and the X/Y
items follow the printed labels too. The choice rewrites the four face bindings only; keyboard keys
and the other inputs stay as they are, and a hand-edited face binding shows as *custom*.
The **Input** menu switches whether keyboard and controllers act as the Wii U GamePad (default)
or as a Wii U Pro Controller (`WWHD_PRO_CONTROLLER=1` starts in that mode); with the Pro
Controller, the GamePad window keeps its screen and touch input.
When the game asks for text (e.g. your name), a macOS text field opens.

Rumble works too (SDL hosts): what the game asks its controller's motor to do is passed to the
connected controllers that have one, which includes the Pro Controller's. A host controller has a
single motor, so a GamePad rumble pattern plays as on/off (or half strength where it alternates),
and the motors stay still while the settings overlay is open, while no game window has focus and
once the app quits. **Controls > Rumble** in the settings overlay (F1) turns it off and is
remembered (`WWHD_RUMBLE=0` starts with it off). The macOS app does not drive controller motors yet.

**Gyro aiming** (settings overlay → **Controls** → **Gyro…**, off by default): in first person the
game turns the camera when the GamePad moves. The port turns its virtual GamePad with a host
controller's gyro (SDL3; on the macOS app through GameController.framework), a Cemuhook (DSU) server
or the mouse (Steam Input "gyro to mouse": while the game aims, the pointer is captured and the mouse
turns the GamePad); it works in GamePad and Pro Controller mode. The axis mode (player space, yaw or
roll), sensitivity and invert per axis, a recalibrate button or key, and the Cemuhook server, port and
slot are saved; `WWHD_GYRO=off|controller|cemuhook|mouse` overrides the source at start. Details,
troubleshooting and what to test: `docs/gyro.md`.

The **Display** menu: full screen for the TV window (**⌘F**, **⌃⌘F** or the green button; the
pointer hides after 2 s without movement), picture scaling (smooth, sharp, or integer scale) and
where the GamePad screen goes: a separate window (which can be put on another display, also in
full screen there), a picture-in-picture overlay in a corner of the TV picture (size, corner and
opacity selectable; click it to touch), an automatic overlay that appears for a few seconds when
the GamePad picture changes a lot (a page or menu switches; **⌘G** keeps it up), off, or *GamePad
only* (the GamePad picture alone in the TV window, click it to touch; Minus in the game switches to
Off-TV Play).
**⌘G** shows/hides the GamePad screen in any mode. Window positions, full screen, these choices
and the renderer are remembered in `~/Library/Application Support/wwhd/display.plist`
(delete it to reset).

Closing the TV window (its close button or **⌘W**) quits the game, as on Linux and Windows; closing
the GamePad window only hides it (**⌘G** brings it back). While a save file is being played, closing
the TV window or **⌘Q** first asks *Quit Wind Waker HD?*: **Quit**, **Cancel** (keep playing), or
**Save State and Quit**, which writes save state slot 1 (Save States menu) and then quits. On the
title screen and the file select, before a file is loaded, it quits without asking.
`WWHD_QUIT_PROMPT=0` turns the question off; scripted and hidden test runs never ask.

## Notes

- Shaders are translated on first use and cached in `~/Library/Caches/wwhd/shaders.bin`; later
  runs replay that cache at startup.
- [docs/performance.md](docs/performance.md) covers how to profile the port, measured fixes and
  open performance leads.
- Useful environment variables: `WWHD_NO_AUDIO=1`, `WWHD_NO_GAMEPAD=1` (no second window), `WWHD_NO_CONTROLLERS=1` (SDL builds: ignore host game controllers), `WWHD_LANGUAGE=<code>` (console language: 1 English, 2 French, 5 Spanish, … — the USA/Asia disc carries English, French and Spanish; a language the game doesn't contain starts in English; with `WWHD_LANGUAGE_REGION=eu` or `jp` from a language source, docs/language-packs.md), `WWHD_RTL=0` / `1` (right-to-left text for Arabic and Hebrew packs off / forced on, docs/rtl-text.md),
  `WWHD_DRC_MODE=window|pip|auto|off|gamepad`, `WWHD_FULLSCREEN=0|1` (the TV window starts windowed / in
  full screen this time instead of as it was left; that session's full screen is not remembered), `WWHD_ASPECT=16:9|window|16:10|21:9|32:9|<w:h>`,
  `WWHD_AUDIO_VOLUME=0..1`, `WWHD_AUDIO_OUTPUT=auto|tv|gamepad` (the host plays the TV's sound, plus the GamePad's in Off-TV Play: auto; or only one of them), `WWHD_SHADER_CACHE=<file>|0`, `WWHD_AO_MODE=0..2`, `WWHD_AO_HIRES=0|1`, `WWHD_ANISO=0|1`, `WWHD_RES_SCALE=1|1.5|2|3`,
  `WWHD_FXAA=0|1`, `WWHD_QUIT_PROMPT=0` (macOS: quit without asking, also during a game), `WWHD_INTERP=1`, `WWHD_INTERP_FPS=60|120|240` (frame interpolation at that rate),
  `WWHD_INTERP_PACED=0|1`, `WWHD_TRUE60=1` (start values for the Graphics menu; they
  override the remembered choices); `WWHD_DISPLAY_HZ=n` replaces the detected display refresh rate
  that 120/240 fps are capped to (0: no cap); `WWHD_UNCAPPED=1` starts with the debug switch
  "Uncapped" on (no frame limit, no vsync; the game runs faster than real time);
  `WWHD_SHADOW_SCALE=n` gives the shadow maps their own resolution factor (by default they scale with
  the internal resolution; since v0.2.9 both look practically the same, issue #67). `=1` keeps the
  console's 1024x1024 and uses much less GPU memory at 2x/3x, useful on weaker hardware; `WWHD_STATE_DIR=<dir>`
  stores save states elsewhere; `WWHD_FULL_SAVE_STATES=0|1` full or portable save states for this
  start; `WWHD_PORTABLE_LOAD=<file.wwstate>` loads that portable state (e.g. from a bug report) as
  soon as a Quest Log is being played; `WWHD_RUMBLE=0|1` (SDL builds) start value for Controls > Rumble (overrides the remembered
  choice); `WWHD_LOG_RUMBLE=1` logs the game's motor requests and what the motors do.
  `WWHD_STRICT_MUL=0` turns off the GPU's 0×anything=0 multiply rule in shaders (on by default, as in
  Cemu; off only for performance comparisons, it brings back e.g. the black letter in the Rito mail sorting game).
- Crashes and game halts write `captures/crash-<time>.log` (crash address, registers, the guest call
  chain, a host backtrace and the last log lines; useful for bug reports, it contains only addresses,
  function names, the file names of the program's modules and log text). A crash address outside the
  game code names its module and offset (`in amdvlk64.dll+0x1A2A01`): a graphics driver, or an
  overlay's Vulkan layer; the log lists the Vulkan layers at start (`[vulkan] layers:`).
- Debugging aids (frame/draw dumps, traces, scheduler statistics) are documented next to their
  code: grep for `WWHD_` in `runtime/src`.

## Optional: bring your GameCube save to HD

`tools/savegame/gc2hd.py` converts a GameCube Wind Waker save (`.gci`, USA GZLE01 or Japanese GZLJ01,
e.g. from a memory-card dump or Dolphin) into a Wind Waker HD save (`cking.sav`), all three files
with their progress, items, songs, charts and story state. It works for this port and for Cemu.

```sh
python3 tools/savegame/gc2hd.py "My Save.gci" -o converted     # writes converted/cking.sav
python3 tools/savegame/hd_save_info.py converted/cking.sav      # shows what is in it
```

Back up your old `cking.sav`, then put the new one in `save/user/` (Cemu:
`mlc01/usr/save/00050000/10143500/user/80000001/` for the USA game). The Tingle Tuner becomes the
Tingle Bottle (HD's item in the same slot); Picto Box photos and HD-only statistics are not carried
over; Japanese player names become "Link". Details and options: [tools/savegame/README.md](tools/savegame/README.md).
Tested with 167 GameCube saves across the whole story (100% and Any% routes).

## Optional: shader head start

The first time a shader is needed it is translated and compiled, which can cause short hitches.
A "head start" pre-translates shaders from the game's own shader archives so later sessions
start with them. It is built locally from your files and is never distributed; without it the
game simply translates shaders on first use.

Building it needs a state template (the GPU register states each shader was used with), which
is recorded from your own play: play for a while (the further you get, the more it covers),
then

```sh
python3 tools/shaderprep.py template ~/Library/Caches/wwhd/shaders.bin   # -> game/shadercache/template.bin
python3 tools/shaderprep.py build                                          # -> game/shadercache/headstart.bin
./build/cmake/wwhd --warm-shaders    # optional: compile everything once to fill the macOS shader cache
```

`--merge game/shadercache/template.bin` adds a later session to an existing template. The runtime
picks up `game/shadercache/headstart.bin` automatically (`WWHD_HEADSTART=<file>|0` overrides it).
See the comment at the top of `tools/shaderprep.py` for the file formats.

## Optional: decompilation tools

`tools/decomp/` names WWHD functions by matching them against the
[zeldaret/tww](https://github.com/zeldaret/tww) GameCube decompilation (CC0); the 60 fps features
are built on those names (`tools/recomp/hooks.txt`, `runtime/src/interp*.cpp`, `runtime/src/true60*.cpp`).
Findings are in `docs/decomp-notes.md`.

`tools/verify/` is a differential test harness for a functionally verified decompilation: it runs
hand-written C++ next to the recompiled original on generated and recorded inputs and compares
return values, memory effects and call sequences (see `tools/verify/README.md`). The verified
source itself is derived from the game and is **not** part of this repository.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/zeldaret/tww tww     # git-ignored reference checkout
python3 tools/decomp/match.py game/code/cking.rpx tww build/names.tsv
```

The assert, string and actor-profile stages only need the decompilation's sources. The
call-graph stage additionally needs the decompilation built (`tww/build/GZLE01`), which in turn
needs `ninja` and your own GameCube disc image of The Wind Waker (USA) as described in the tww
README. `build/names.tsv` is derived from the game and stays on your machine.

## Status

The opening of the game (title, file select, intro, Outset Island) is tested and matches Cemu
side by side, at a steady 30 fps (the console's frame rate) and at 60 fps with interpolation;
true 60 is experimental. Known gaps: geometry shaders and rectangle
primitives are not implemented yet (not encountered so far), shadow edges are harder than on
the console, startup sometimes sits on a black screen for up to a minute before the logo
(a timing-dependent wait during audio initialization, under investigation), and later parts of
the game are untested.
